                <tr><td><img class="antagonistsImg" src="images/image4.jpg" width="60%" height="10%"></td><td>Michael Fassbender</td><td>Edwin Epps</td><td>He is the main antagonist of the critically acclaimed 2013 film 12 Years A Slave. He is Northup’s third and final master who is a cruel, ruthless, and abusive man, who believe that beating a man signaled victory. He was also an alcoholic, who indulged in immoral, sexually abusive against the slaves. Epps treated all his slaves in a dehumanizing way including Solomon (whom he knows as Platt), but reserves particularly brutal treatment to an elderly male slave named Abram and a young, pretty female slave named Patsey. He is a cotton planter and he owned Northup for about ten years before he was freed by his friends from the North.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><img class="antagonistsImg" src="images/image5.jpg" width="60%" height="20%"></td><td>Christopher Berry</td><td>James Burch</td><td>A brutal slave dealer who first kept Solomon Northup in captivity in Washington, D.C. A business partner with Theophilus Freeman of New Orleans. Burch shackled Northup in a hidden slave pen and then, apparently enraged by Northup’s claims that he was a free man, beat and whipped Solomon into submission. After the brutal beating, Burch threatened to kill Solomon if he ever mentioned his freedom or background again. Believing that threat applied to all slavers, Northup never spoke to anyone again of his being born free until nearly 12 years later. Upon being emancipated, Northup and his lawyer pressed criminal charges against Burch and his accomplice, Ebenezer Radburn. However, Burch prevailed in the proceedings by hiring false witnesses to testify on his behalf.</td></tr>
                <tr><td><img class="antagonistsImg" src="images/image6.jpg" width="60%" height="10%"></td><td>Paul Dano</td><td>John Tibeats</td><td>A white carpenter who worked for William Ford. In 1842, he took possession of Solomon Northup as payment of a debt by William Ford. Described as a “quick-tempered, spiteful man,” Tibeats was Northup’s archenemy. More than once, he tried to kill Solomon out of anger but was prevented each time. Eventually, he sold Solomon to the cruel cotton planter, Edwin Epps.</td></tr>
